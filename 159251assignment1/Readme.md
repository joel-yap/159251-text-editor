The program has five main tabs, File, Search and View are functional. 

File has the New, Open, Save, Exit and Print menu items.
New opens a dialog window to clear all editor pane text with or without saving.
Open opens a dialog window to select and open a text or ODT file.
Save opens a dialog window to save text files in a chosen location.
Exit closes the current frame.
Print opens a window to print the editor text content or save as PDF.

Search allows the user to enter a word and jump to the matching word in the editor pane.

View has a Display Date And Time function which replaces the current editor pane text with the current date and time.
